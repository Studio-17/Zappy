## About the project

**The aim of this project is to develop a network game that artificial intelligences will play as a team in order to win the game.**

The goal of the game itself is to survive and reproduce by collecting resources to perform rituals and level up. The first AI team to reach level 8 wins the game. The zappy project is separated into three distinct parts:
- **Server**: Allows the progress of the game by establishing communication with the artificial intelligences
- **GUI**: Graphical interface connecting to the server in order to follow the progress of the game
- **AI**: Client connecting to server to play automatically
